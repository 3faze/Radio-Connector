# Radio-Connector
This is a small project I developed that basicly hosts a server for receiving and sending packets. 
These packets tell you what kind of activities are going on in the radio spectrum. It also tells you when they are happening and where(frequency).

I just did this so I could learn a bit about networking with python.
